The rise of misinformation and fake news has become a major concern, especially on social media and news websites

Project Explanation: Fake News Detection Using BERT

In this project, I am building a system that can automatically tell if a news article is real or fake using machine learning. To do this, I am using a powerful tool called *BERT*, which is a type of algorithm that helps computers understand human language.

What is BERT?
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a machine learning model that helps the system understand the meaning of words and sentences in context. It reads a sentence both from left to right and right to left, making it better at understanding the true meaning of a sentence.

How Does the Fake News Detection System Work?
1. Collecting Data: First, I gather a collection of news articles. Some of these articles are real, and others are fake.
2. Training the Model: I use this data to train the BERT model. During training, BERT learns to recognize patterns in the text that might indicate whether a news article is real or fake.
3. Classifying News: Once the model is trained, it can take a new, unseen news article and predict whether it is fake or real based on what it has learned.

Why BERT?
BERT is good at understanding the meaning behind words in a sentence, not just looking for simple keywords. This helps the system make better decisions about whether a news article is fake or real, even if the language used is tricky or misleading.

The Goal:
The goal of this project is to create a system that can quickly and accurately detect fake news articles. This will help people avoid being misled by false information and make it easier to trust news sources.
